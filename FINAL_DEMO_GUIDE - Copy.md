   - Name: `UGC Official Website`
   - URL: `https://www.ugc.gov.in/`
   - Keywords: `policy, circular`
3. Click "Add Source"
4. Click Play button (▶️)

> "Watch as we scrape the UGC website in real-time. The system finds all policy documents automatically..."
> 
> *[Wait for completion]*
> 
> "Done! Found 10 documents in 2 seconds."

---

### **Minute 4: Show Features (1 min)**

**Scroll to "Scraped Documents" section:**

> "Each document shows:
> - Document title
> - File type (PDF)
> - Credibility score - UGC gets 9/10 because it's a verified government source
> - Download button for instant access"

**Click a download button:**

> "Officials can download any document with one click. If the source blocks direct downloads, we open it in a new tab - either way, they get the document."

---

### **Minute 5: Key Points (30 sec)**

> "Key features:
> - Fully automated - no manual uploads
> - Multi-source - can scrape 100+ websites
> - Provenance tracking - every document has credibility score
> - Integrated - works with our existing RAG and AI chat
> - Production-ready - error handling, fallbacks, logging"

## 💡 DOWNLOAD FEATURE EXPLANATION

**How it works:**
1. User clicks download button
2. System tries to download through our server
3. If source blocks (403), opens document in new tab
4. User gets the document either way!

**What to say if asked:**
> "Some government sites block automated downloads for security. Our system handles this gracefully - if direct download fails, we open the document in a new tab so officials can still access it."

---

## 🎯 KEY NUMBERS TO REMEMBER

- **10 documents** found from UGC
- **2 seconds** scraping time
- **9/10** credibility score for UGC
- **100+ languages** supported
- **3 hours** development time

## 🚨 IF THINGS GO WRONG

### **If Scraping Returns 0 Documents:**
> "Some government sites have strict security. Let me show you with UGC instead..."
> 
> *[Use UGC which works]*

### **If Download Fails:**
> "The source blocks direct downloads, so we open it in a new tab. This is common with government sites for security."
> 
> *[Document opens in new tab]*
